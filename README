ipm stands for IP Manager (http://flant.ru/projects/ipm)

ipm (IP Manager) is a simple tool on Python used for managing
network interfaces (IP addresses and routing) in GNU/Linux.

ipm was created for routers operating a lot of IP addresses.
After configuring network interfaces in a simple YAML file,
these settings can be applied (added/removed/updated) with
ipm.

Being multithreaded, ipm can configure hundreds of IP addresses
in a few seconds.
